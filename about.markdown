Hey! It's nice to meet you. I'm Daniel and in this section I'd like to talk a little bit
about me.

I'm a linguist by profession. "How did you end up interested in programming then?," you wonder.

It was just a spontaneous decision. I wanted to learn a new, different and motivating skill and I've found it in programming.

I'm amazed by how software technologies embrace every aspect of our daily lives.
And even though I wish to learn and know more about everything, at this stage of my journey
I want to focus on subjects such as: WebGL, WebXR, computer graphics, 3d rendering, XR, AR, VR, MR, generative and creative programming, computational geometry... and related stuff.

Yeah, I'm interested in softwares for manipulating visual content. My first publications will tackle simple issues and as I go deeper into these subjects I hope to generate more complex content.

I'm excited to share with you what I'll be learning. As a result, my posts may be a helpful resource if you`re motivated in these topics as much as I am.

Welcome! Â¡Bienvenido! Bienvenue! Willkommen! Benvenuto!
