We have discussed previuosly how to create [paths and subpaths](https://danielmart-tech.github.io/canvas/2022/10/14/paths-in-canvas.html) to create different shapes and figures. But the Canvas API offers us an interface as well for declaring a path that will be used a posteriori, that is to say, the **Path2D** interface. It then can be used in a [*CanvasRenderingContext2D*](https://danielmart-tech.github.io/canvas/2022/09/23/brief-intro-canvas-api.html) object.

To create an object we need to call the *Path2D* constructor. Optionally we can add another path as an argument:

<pre><code>new Path2D()
new Path2D(path) // optional argument
</code></pre>

Let's see how we can create basic shapes with this interface:

<pre><code>const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas")
const context = canvas.getContext("2d")

/* 
Beginning a new path
and adding a rectangle
*/
const path1 = new Path2D()
path1.rect(5, 5, 60, 60)

/*
Beginning a second path
and adding an arc.
It also includes a copy of the path1 object.
*/
const path2 = new Path2D(path1)
path2.arc(120, 50, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);

/*
Rendering the path2 object which includes an arc
and a rectangle (as a result of the copy of path1).
*/
context.fill(path2)
</code></pre>

The path methods we have written about in our previous posts are also present in the *Path2D* interface:

1. [Path2D.addPath()](https://danielmart-tech.github.io/canvas/2022/10/14/paths-in-canvas.html)
2. [Path2D.closePath()](https://danielmart-tech.github.io/canvas/2022/10/14/paths-in-canvas.html)
3. [Path2D.moveTo()](https://danielmart-tech.github.io/canvas/2022/10/14/paths-in-canvas.html)
4. [Path2D.lineTo()](https://danielmart-tech.github.io/canvas/2022/10/14/paths-in-canvas.html)
5. [Path2D.bezierCurveTo()](https://danielmart-tech.github.io/canvas/2022/11/18/bezier-curves-canvas.html)
6. [Path2D.quadraticCurveTo()](https://danielmart-tech.github.io/canvas/2022/11/18/bezier-curves-canvas.html)
7. [Path2D.arc](https://danielmart-tech.github.io/canvas/2022/11/25/arcs-canvas.html)
8. [Path2D.arcTo()](https://danielmart-tech.github.io/canvas/2022/11/25/arcs-canvas.html)
9. [Path2D.ellipse()](https://danielmart-tech.github.io/canvas/2022/11/25/arcs-canvas.html)
10. [Path2D.rect()](https://danielmart-tech.github.io/canvas/2022/12/02/path-for-rectangles-canvas.html)
11. [Path2D.roundRect()](https://danielmart-tech.github.io/canvas/2022/12/02/path-for-rectangles-canvas.html)
